Backend API Reference
=====================

Pub/Sub subscriptions
---------------------

.. index:: triple: Subscribe; Pub-Sub; Lattice API
.. http:PUT:: /v1/connection/(str:conn_id)/subscriptions/(path:topic)

   Subscribe client with ``conn_id`` to specific topic ``topic``.

   Request body is not used.

   Client will receive ``topic`` with ``/`` substituted with ``.``,
   for instance the ``channel/general`` topic will become
   ``channel.general`` in client message.

   Example:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      PUT /v1/connection/nb9NC-HpR/subscriptions/channel/general HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
      Content-Length: 0


.. index:: triple: Unsubscribe; Pub-Sub; Lattice API
.. http:DELETE:: /v1/connection/(str:conn_id)/subscriptions/(path:topic)

   Unsubscribe client with ``conn_id`` from specific ``topic``.

   Request body is not used.

   Example:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      DELETE /v1/connection/nb9NC-HpR/subscriptions/channel/general HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
      Content-Length: 0

.. _topic-publish:

.. index:: triple: Publish; Pub-Sub; Lattice API
.. http:POST:: /v1/publish/(path:topic)

   Publish JSON message to all subscribed clients.
   See also :ref:`front-messsage`.

   Request body **must** be a valid JSON.

   Example:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      POST /v1/publish/channel/general HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Content-Type: application/json

Lattice Subscriptions
---------------------

.. index:: triple: Subscribe; Lattice; Lattice API

      Content-Length: 0

   .. note:: Lattice name can't start with ``swindon/`` (or ``swindon.`` as
      seen in frontend. These lattices are reserved.

.. index:: triple: Unubscribe; Lattice; Lattice API
.. http:DELETE:: /v1/connection/(str:conn_id)/lattices/(path:namespace)

   Unsubscribe client with ``conn_id`` from lattice ``namespace``.

   .. sourcecode:: http

      POST /v1/lattice/test-chat/rooms HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Content-Type: application/json
      Content-Length: 308

      {"shared": {
          "room1": {"last_message_counter": 123},
          "room2": {"last_message_counter": 245}},
       "private": {
         "7777": {
          "room1": {"last_seen_counter": 120},
          "room2": {"last_seen_counter": 245}},
         "8734": {
          "room1": {"last_seen_counter": 123},
          "room2": {"last_seen_counter": 24}}
      }}

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
      Content-Length: 0

   The ``shared`` attribute contains keys in the lattice that will be shared
   between users. The ``private`` part is keyed by a user id and contain
   same kind of object for each user.

   Each key-value pair in that object is a CRDT variable-value. The type of
   the variable is defined by the suffix. The types of variables are
   defined in :ref:`CRDT Types <crdt-types>` section.

   There is one special key supported in ``private`` section (the plan is to
   add public expiration later too):

   .. _expires_in:
   .. index:: pair: expires_in; Lattice API

   expires_in
      A time after which entry will be automatically deleted on server-side.
      It's duration string like "10 seconds", "10s", or "90 minutes" in
      a `human-readable format`__

      **(this functionality is experimental)**

Users Lattice
-------------

Users lattice, is a special lattice that is named ``swindon.user`` from the
viewpoint of the server, but has different server-side API:

.. index:: triple: Subscribe; Users Lattice; Lattice API
.. http:PUT:: /v1/connection/(str:conn_id)/users

   Subscribe client with ``conn_id`` to ``swindon.user`` namespace and
   show they the status of specified users:

   Example:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      PUT /v1/connection/nb9NC-HpR/users HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Content-Type: application/json
      Content-Length: 109

      ["7777", "8734"]

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
      Content-Length: 0

.. index:: triple: Update; Users Lattice; Lattice API
.. http:PUT:: /v1/user/(str:user_id)/users

   Add all user ids sent in this request to all the connections of
   the user named ``user_id`` (which are subscribed to user status via
   call above).

   In other words show users specified in the body of this request to
   user ``user_id`` (but only their connections that already subscribed to
   the ``swindon.user`` namespace).


   Example:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      PUT /v1/user/7777/users HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Content-Type: application/json
      Content-Length: 109

      ["8734"]

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
      Content-Length: 0


.. index:: triple: Unubscribe; Users Lattice; Lattice API
.. http:DELETE:: /v1/connection/(str:conn_id)/users

   Unsubscribe client with ``conn_id`` from lattice ``swindon.user``.

   Example:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      DELETE /v1/connection/nb9NC-HpR/users HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Content-Length: 0

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
      Content-Length: 0


Parameters specification
------------------------


The following table shows allowed character sets for corresponding URL
componets.

   +---------------+-------------------+
   | Parameter     | Valid Characters  |
   +===============+===================+
   | Topic, UserID | ``a-zA-Z0-9:_/-`` |
   +---------------+-------------------+
   | Namespace     | ``a-zA-Z0-9_/-``  |
   +---------------+-------------------+
   | Connection ID | ``a-zA-Z0-9_-``   |
   +---------------+-------------------+

Valid topics/namespaces example::

   valid/topic/value
   valid-topic-value
   valid_topic_value
   still-valid-topic/value:1
   1/2/3
   valid/namespace

Invalid topics/namespaces::

   not,a,valid,topic
   topic.with.dots


API response status codes
-------------------------

In case of valid request (correct URL and valid data) endpoints
respond with ``204 No Content`` status code.
This must be considered successful call.

Any of above endpoints call also respond with following codes signaling error:

* ``400 Bad Request``

   May be returned in the following cases:

   * Request with body sent to endpoint that does not expect body.

   * Request without body sent to endpoint that expects body.

   * Request body is not valid JSON.

   * Request JSON body has invalid format (for lattice endpoints).

* ``404 Not Found``

   May be caused by either invalid URL path (or one of its components) or
   unsupported request method.
